# Declare/discuss any aspects of your code that are not working. What are your intuitions about why they are not working? Acknowledge and discuss any parts of the program that appear to be inefficient.
When I was writing the tests, there was an issue in which in Simple1, the paths the algorithm came up with did not pass
my hand written tests in SPT (ShortestPathsTest). This turned out to be a flaw in which when I drew the Simple 1 graph,
I had flipped the edge's direction to the wrong node meaning I had to redo the entire test, thankfully after that all
tests passed. The inefficiency of the tests and how I wrote them might have been flawed as instead of writing a for loop
as I've realized what I should have done earlier, I wrote the test down 1 by 1 which turned out to be really inefficient.

# What are some of the most important lessons you learned while working on this assignment? Why do you think so?
I have never really liked AI in general as I didn't ever really trust it and always found it inefficient but after
talking to other people in my field of interest who have graduated from University, I have realized the strengths of AI
which include it's very reliable when writing algorithms compared to stringing multiple ideas together which is why it
can fail, but if used properly can make a really efficient version of said algorithm. I also again sought out the help
of experts including family and friends who are more knowledgeable and qualified compared to me realizing that working
on assignments alone and using 1 mind only is really inefficient and unproductive handicapping my learning.

# What was the most challenging aspect of this assignment? Why?
The most challenging aspect was the understanding of the assignment and the manual work, I found that when writing the
tests you have to manually check every single possible path and that it aligns with what is expected and actual results.
I also found that checking the logic of the algorithm was also pretty tedious making sure that it was actually Dijkstra's
algorithm and also verifying that the results of the output given to me were reliable, I found when going through the logic
of the algorithm and tests I truly understand and feel knowledgeable when it comes to Dijkstra's algorithm and making test cases.
Writing the tests and going through the process really helped me deepen my understanding of computer science and this was
definitely the most productive assignment when it came to learning for me.
